1. import random
  random.randint(a,b): random int from a->b
  random.random(): random float number from 0 to 1
  random.randn([d0,d1,d2]): return a d0*d1*d2 array of standard normal distribution, if d not provided, return a float of standard normal distribution 
  
2. TF-IDF: term frequency-Inverse document frequency
  term frequency: number of occurances of a word in a documnet
  document frequency: the number of documents where a term occurs
  score = TF/DF = TF*IDF
