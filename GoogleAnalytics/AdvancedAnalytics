# Chapter1

1.1 How GA collects data: By hit, which contains multiple information about that hit, like users screen resolution, lenguage, name of the page viewing, analytics ID

    Three types of hits: Pageview -> when user view a page
                         Event ->  when user iteracts with the page, like clicking the video playing button, 
                                   includes information of: Action, Category, Label, Value
                         Trasaction(Ecommerce) hit: product purchased, product ID. and stock keeping units(SKU)
                         
                         Social hits: like, sharing, 
                         Page Timing hits: page timing

1.2 Categorizing into users and sessions
    • new user vs returning user: track by cookie, same device and same browse -> same user
                                                   different device -> new user
                                                   cookie blocked or cleaned -> new user
                                                   If want track across device -> enable UerID 
    
    •session: to learn how user engage with the website, group the hits based on the time which the hits were generated
    
    •other data source
    
1.3 Transforming data using configuration riles:
    • Filters
    • Golas: Destination/Pageviews -> when user lands on page of website
             Event -> When user performs spercific actions
             Duration -> Seesions over set amount of time
             Pages/Screens per Session -> User views set amount of pages within session
             
1.4 Storing and Generating reports
    Avg Session Time: Avge time user spend from the first to the last hit during a session
    Bounce Rate: rate of user who only has one iteration on your site without a secon iteraction to calculate
    
    levels of dimenssion: •Hit level: page title
                          •Session level: device category
                          •User level: User type
    Standard users, session defined before the view, so there are fewer sessions in the view
    When you define a filter in the view, the data filtered will not be recovered
    
1.5 Creating a measurement plan
    •set macro objective and micro objective
    •
    
    
    
#Chapter 2 Setting up data collection and configuration 
 
2.1 Organize and analytics account
        •1 Organization
        •1 account
        •1 or more property -> 3 veiws: raw data view, test view, master view
        
     cross-domain tracking  or site linking: tracking one property in different website with different URLs
                                             It can recognize when user explores between related website during one session
                                             need to modify tracking code -> google Tag
2.2 Set up filters
    Predefined
    Custom
                                  
2.3 Create custom Dimensions: Similar to default dimensions, but you define what they are and the value                                   
    eg: (php), get the author          
                    ga('send', 'pageview', {
                      'dimension5': '<?=$author?>'
                    });          
    
2.4 Create custom metrics:
    eg:
    
2.5 Understand user behavior with event tracking:
    • for each event, need to add tracking code for that button
    • once clicked, event will sending code including: Category, action, label, value -> Videos, play, [name of the video, numerical value like the amount of time]
    • Total event, unique event
    
2.6.1 Set up internal site search: session with search
                                   total unique searches
                                   results pageviews/search
                                   %search exits -> percentage of immediately exit atfer search ->25.8%
                                   %search refinements -> percentage of immediately second search after the first one -> 25.02%
                                   time after search-> 2:14
                                   average search depth: number of pages viewed after getting back search results -> 4.29
2.6.2 Calculated metrics: view -> calculated metrics
2.6.3 Channel grouping: direct, organic search, paid search, email, refferal, social, display, affliates


#Chapter 3 Advanced Analysis Tools and Techniques

3.1 Segment data for insight: 
    • User segment: span multiple sessions, max date range 90 days
                    age+date+gender
    • Session segment: sigle session
                        gola completed
    • Avcanced custom filter -> title -> contain "Android"
    
3.2 Multi-channel Funnel reports for analysis: Can tell you what role prior marketing activity played in the conversion process
    • Last click attribution model
