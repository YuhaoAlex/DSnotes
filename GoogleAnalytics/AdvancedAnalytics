1.1 How GA collects data: By hit, which contains multiple information about that hit, like users screen resolution, lenguage, name of the page viewing, analytics ID

    Three types of hits: Pageview -> when user view a page
                         Event ->  when user iteracts with the page, like clicking the video playing button, 
                                   includes information of: Action, Category, Label, Value
                         Trasaction(Ecommerce) hit: product purchased, product ID. and stock keeping units(SKU)
                         
                         Social hits: like, sharing, 
                         Page Timing hits: page timing

1.2 Categorizing into users and sessions
    • new user vs returning user: track by cookie, same device and same browse -> same user
                                                   different device -> new user
                                                   cookie blocked or cleaned -> new user
                                                   If want track across device -> enable UerID 
    
    •session: to learn how user engage with the website, group the hits based on the time which the hits were generated
    
    •other data source
    
1.3 Transforming data using configuration riles:
    • Filters
    • Golas: Destination/Pageviews -> when user lands on page of website
             Event -> When user performs spercific actions
             Duration -> Seesions over set amount of time
             Pages/Screens per Session -> User views set amount of pages within session
             
1.4 Storing and Generating reports
    Avg Session Time: Avge time user spend from the first to the last hit during a session
    Bounce Rate: rate of user who only has one iteration on your site without a secon iteraction to calculate
    
    levels of dimenssion: •Hit level: page title
                          •Session level: device category
                          •User level: User type
    Standard users, session defined before the view, so there are fewer sessions in the view
    When you define a filter in the view, the data filtered will not be recovered
    
1.5 Creating a measurement plan
    •set macro objective and micro objective

 Chapter 2 Setting up data collection and configuration 
 
2.1 Organize and analytics account
        •1 Organization
        •1 account
        •1 or more property -> 3 veiws: raw data view, test view, master view
        
     cross-domain tracking  or site linking: tracking one property in different website with different URLs
                                             It can recognize when user explores between related website during one session
                                             need to modify tracking code -> google Tag
2.2 Set up filters
    Predefined
    Custom
                                  
2.3 Create custom Dimensions: Similar to default dimensions, but you define what they are and the value
