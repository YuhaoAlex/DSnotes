1. myisam vs innodb

2. types of lock: 
    reading lock: only for read, no writing 
    writing lock: block other user's reading and writing : 
                                                          table lock, row lock

3. ACID:
  Atomicity:Transactions are often composed of multiple statements. Atomicity guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single "unit", which either succeeds completely, or fails completely 
  
  Consostency: Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants
  
  Isolation:Transactions are often executed concurrently, Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially
  
  Durability: Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure 
  
4. what to ensure ACID
  Atomicity: undo log,  记录了需要回滚的日志信息，回滚时撤销已经执行成功的sql
  C: 代码层面
  I: MVCC
  D: 持久性memory和redo log
  
5. MVCC(multi version concurrency control:
  MVCC provides each user connected to the database with a "snapshot" of the data to work with.
  provides concurrent access to the database without locking the data. This feature improves the performance of database applications in a multiuser environment
 
 幻读
 
6.你们数据量级多大？分库分表怎么做的？
  先垂直后水平
  首先根据业务场景来决定使用什么字段作为分表字段(sharding_key)，比如我们现在日订单1000万，我们大部分的场景来源于C端，我们可以用user_id作为sharding_key，数据查询支持到最近3个月的订单，
  超过3个月的做归档处理，那么3个月的数据量就是9亿，可以分1024张表，那么每张表的数据大概就在100万左右。比如用户id为100，那我们都经过hash(100)，然后对1024取模，就可以落到对应的表上了。
  
  
7.isolation 的级别
  read uncommited:
  read commited:
  repeatable read:
  serializable:
